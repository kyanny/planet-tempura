# Planet Tempura

<http://tempura.8-p.info/>

Planet Tempura is a planet for Japanese who blog about software
development in English.

## Hey, I have an English blog!

Cool. Please add your blog to planet.ini. The process is "as usual",
open a pull request!

## I sometimes write an article in English, but mainly in Japanese.

It's ok. Japanese articles are automatically excluded from the planet.
